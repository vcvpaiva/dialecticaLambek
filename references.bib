	abstract = {Current supervised parsers are limited by the size of their labelled training data, making improving them with unlabelled data an important goal. We show how a state-of-the-art CCG parser can be enhanced, by predicting lexical categories using unsupervised vector-space embeddings of words. The use of word embeddings enables our model to better generalize from the labelled data, and allows us to accurately assign lexical categories without depending on a POS-tagger. Our approach leads to substantial improvements in dependency parsing results over the standard supervised CCG parser when evaluated on Wall Street Journal (0.8\%), Wikipedia (1.8\%) and biomedical (3.4\%) text. We compare the performance of two recently proposed approaches for classification using a wide variety of word embeddings. We also give a detailed error analysis demonstrating where using embeddings outperforms traditional feature sets, and showing how including POS features can decrease accuracy. },

We introduce the substructural hierarchy ‚Äî a new classification of logical axioms (algebraic equations) over full Lambek calculus FL, and show that a stronger form of cut-elimination for extensions of \{FL\} and the MacNeille completion for subvarieties of pointed residuated lattices coincide up to the level N 2 in the hierarchy. Negative results, which indicate limitations of cut-elimination and the MacNeille completion, as well as of the expressive power of structural sequent calculus rules, are also provided. Our arguments interweave proof theory and algebra, leading to an integrated discipline which we call algebraic proof theory. "
